This is the sourcecode of the OntoImport Suite.

To run/compile the Java source, use NetBeans 8.0. Each project needs to be configured before it can be executed:

- For each project, set up a valid execution path (use a copy of the binary distribution).

- Include the JAR libraries from the binary distribution into the build path for each project.
